# Baselyne Systems - Full Documentation for LLMs

> AI infrastructure, data engineering, and MLOps consulting. We help teams move AI from experimentation into production.

## Company Overview

Baselyne Systems is a founder-led consulting firm specializing in AI infrastructure, data engineering, and MLOps. We work with companies that need to move AI from experimentation into production but lack the infrastructure expertise to do it reliably.

Our founder brings nearly a decade of infrastructure engineering experience, including six years at Meta and Alphabet, working on petabyte-scale data platforms, systems handling 100M+ queries per second, and complex data governance for GDPR compliance.

We take that experience and apply it to companies at earlier stages, helping them build infrastructure that will scale with their ambitions rather than becoming a bottleneck.

## Services

### Data Infrastructure Consulting

**URL:** https://baselynesystems.com/services/data-infrastructure-consulting

**What we do:**
Modern AI needs more than batch pipelines. We build data platforms that power analytics, ML training, RAG systems, and the next generation of AI applications.

**The problem we solve:**
Most data platforms were designed for batch analytics and dashboards. Now you need them to power ML models, RAG systems, real-time applications, and AI agents. The architecture that worked for BI often breaks under these new demands.

AI workloads need fresh data, not overnight ETL. They need vector search and embeddings, not just SQL. They need semantic understanding of your data, not just table schemas. And they need governance that extends to AI systems.

**Capabilities:**
- Lakehouse Architecture: Modern data platforms on Delta Lake, Iceberg, or Hudi. Designed for analytics, ML training, and AI workloads with governance from day one.
- Real-time & Batch Pipelines: Streaming pipelines for real-time AI access alongside batch processing. Sub-second freshness where needed, cost-efficient batch where not.
- AI-ready Governance: Lineage tracking, access controls, and quality metrics that extend to AI systems. Meet GDPR, SOC2, and HIPAA without slowing down your team.
- Semantic Data Layer: Metadata, descriptions, and relationships that make data discoverable and usable—by both humans and AI systems.
- Vector & Hybrid Search: Vector stores, embedding pipelines, and hybrid search for RAG and semantic search. Infrastructure that makes retrieval actually work.

**Outcomes:**
- Data freshness reduced from hours to minutes or seconds
- RAG retrieval accuracy improved through better data modeling
- End-to-end lineage from source data through AI outputs
- Query performance improved 10-100x through optimization
- GDPR/SOC2 compliance with AI-aware controls
- Storage costs reduced 40-60% through intelligent tiering

### MLOps Consulting

**URL:** https://baselynesystems.com/services/mlops-consulting

**What we do:**
Get AI from prototype to production. The gap between a working prototype and a production system is larger than most teams expect. We bridge that gap with infrastructure for deploying, versioning, and monitoring ML models and LLM-powered applications.

**The problem we solve:**
Your team has built models that work in development. But getting them into production—with proper versioning, monitoring, and the ability to roll back when things go wrong—is a different challenge entirely.

Most organizations underestimate the operational complexity. Building a working model is maybe 20% of the work. The rest is infrastructure: versioning, evaluation pipelines, serving infrastructure, observability, and processes for continuous improvement.

**Capabilities:**
- Model & Prompt Versioning: Version control for models, prompts, and configurations. Track what changed, when, and why. Roll back to any previous version instantly.
- Deployment Infrastructure: Serving infrastructure for ML models and LLM applications. Canary deployments, A/B testing, shadow mode, and automated rollback.
- Evaluation & Monitoring: Automated evaluation pipelines for model quality. Track accuracy, latency, cost, and drift. Catch regressions before users do.
- ML Pipeline Orchestration: Automated training and inference pipelines. Scheduled retraining, data validation, model evaluation gates, and workflow management.
- Continuous Improvement: Feedback loops from production to development. Capture failures, evaluate alternatives, and deploy improvements with confidence.

**Outcomes:**
- Deployment time reduced from weeks to hours
- Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollbacks
- Regressions caught in evaluation before production
- Full lineage from training data to production predictions
- Reproducible configurations with version control
- Self-service deployment for ML and AI teams

### AI Infrastructure Consulting

**URL:** https://baselynesystems.com/services/ai-infrastructure-consulting

**What we do:**
Scalable AI compute with cost control. GPU and LLM costs can spiral without proper controls. We build AI infrastructure that gives teams the compute they need while maintaining visibility and control over spend.

**The problem we solve:**
Most teams start AI projects with managed APIs or a few GPUs. As usage grows, so do problems: costs spike unpredictably, GPU utilization hovers at 30%, and there's no visibility into what's driving spend or why systems fail.

The transition from prototypes to production AI requires infrastructure expertise that most teams lack. Self-hosted models, GPU orchestration, LLM serving, cost attribution—each domain has its own complexity.

**Capabilities:**
- GPU Orchestration: Kubernetes-based platforms for training and inference. Right-sized clusters with autoscaling that responds to actual demand.
- Cost Attribution & Control: Clear visibility into cost per team, project, and model. Budgets, alerts, and optimization recommendations before costs spiral.
- Security & Compliance: Network isolation, secrets management, and audit logging. Infrastructure that passes security reviews the first time.
- LLM Serving Infrastructure: Production-grade infrastructure for serving LLMs. vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or managed endpoints—optimized for your latency and cost requirements.
- AI Observability: Tracing, logging, and monitoring for AI systems. Debug failures, track behavior, and understand why models perform the way they do.

**Outcomes:**
- GPU utilization increased from 30% to 80%+
- LLM costs reduced 50-80% through optimization
- Inference latency optimized for production SLAs
- Clear cost attribution per team, project, and model
- Security and compliance requirements met on first audit
- Team self-service for AI resources without bottlenecks

## Our Approach

**URL:** https://baselynesystems.com/approach

Our approach is built around production readiness, not impressive demos. Every engagement follows a structured process:

1. **Assessment (1-2 weeks):** We start by understanding your current state. This means reviewing architecture, talking to your team, and identifying the critical gaps between where you are and where you need to be.

2. **Scope Definition:** Based on the assessment, we define a focused scope. We're explicit about what's in and out, what success looks like, and the trade-offs involved in different approaches.

3. **Implementation:** We build alongside your team, not in isolation. Weekly syncs, shared code repositories, and continuous documentation ensure knowledge transfer happens naturally.

4. **Handover (2-4 weeks):** Before we step back, we ensure your team can operate independently. This includes training, shadowed on-call rotations, and support during the transition period.

**Principles:**
- Production first: Everything we build is designed for production from day one.
- Documentation as deliverable: Code without documentation creates dependency.
- Knowledge transfer built-in: We work alongside your engineers, not in a silo.
